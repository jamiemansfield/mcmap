Free Minecraft Mappings
=======================

Contained within this repository is my personal mapping set for Minecraft, that I worked on for
about a month. I have decided to open these up, and the tooling to maintain them as I don't see
myself working on them actively again.

The mappings aim for the most-accurate naming possible, with few rules:

- The mappings expose *original* alphabetical order, it should be roughly followed
- British English, even where it conflicts with a 3rd-party libraries naming

Accuracy is achieved by using the many bits and bobs that Mojang have showed off through the years:

- World Format and NBT
  - [Mojang: "New Minecraft Map Format, "Anvil"](https://mojang.com/2012/02/new-minecraft-map-format-anvil/)
  - [Mojang: "Minecraft Save File Format in Beta 1.3"](https://mojang.com/2011/02/minecraft-save-file-format-in-beta-1-3/)
    - [Scaevolus: "region.c"](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/*/https://mod.ifies.com/f/110216/region.c)

Now for the name - "Free Minecraft Mappings", which is more aptly-named than creative. I am decided
to release these mappings, and the tooling under very permissive licences.

- Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 for the mappings
  - These mappings should not be used for commercial purposes
  - I encourage people to make their own adaptions of these mappings, but I think sharing back is
    very useful here
- Mozila Public License 2.0 for the tooling
  - Just a nice licence :)
